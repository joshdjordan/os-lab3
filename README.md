Lab3

fairly basic -> import all source files to the grid and run command:

'./make-disk mydisk0' or whatever you want to name the disk, if you name the disk something different make sure to also change it in the instructions file

once the disk is created go ahead and run the makefile by entering 'make' into terminal. the script will run everything

proceed by entering './lab3' into command line once again and the rest should be fully automated from this point as the file will execute
